# Website-Project
A Website for an Information Systems Project. The website is still under construction, it will be changed to fit a specific business idea or I might clone the template and keep this as a separate project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project entails setting up a small, visually-appealing commercial e-commerce website for a product or service with the following core requirements:

 Fairly extensive product/service catalogue
 Social media integration
 Search-engine readiness
 Client communication (contact us)
 Business information (about us, legal, shipping info, etc.)
 Shopping cart
 Checkout
 History of orders
 Intelligent, appropriate and justified use of multimedia


Above and beyond this, students are encouraged to include features that go further than these base
requirements. A non-exhaustive list of suggestions includes:

 Item or choice-based cross-selling (‘if you’re interested in this then…’)
 Customer loyalty program signup (mailing list, newsletter, etc.)
 Banner-advertising support
 Wish list
 Site Search functionality
